    <h2>Qualitative Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I am very detail oriented and very thourough and but it can cause me to get really caught up with the small things and take longer than I need to.</li>
            <li>I am also a bit of a perfectionist so I work really hard to acheive the goals I set but if something isn't working or going to plan I tend to start completely over.</li>
            <li> I am kind of an out of the box thinker so sometimes I can come up with good new solutions to problems but sometimes the ideas dont work out and I waste time on it.  </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Quantitative Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As a cashier I have helped thousands of customers.</li>
            <li>I got a 5 star review on my first day at my last job.</li>
            <li> I saved the company I worked for before that $2000 in asset losses by working with asset protection.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Passion Project</h2>
        <p>A passion project of mine is a table top game called Warhammer 40k. For this game you buy the pieces which are unassembled and unpainted, and in order to use them you have to put them together which allows some flexibility in how you do so. Kind of a mix and match sort of thing to customize your army. Once you have the pieces put together, you paint them and you really get what you put into it here. You have total contol over the appearance of your army. Once you are ready to play the game is when the logical thinking comes in. The game is very strategic and you need to try to plan ahead as many moves as you can, and one bad turn can change the tides of the game. Overall it is a multi-faceted hobby that is a lot of fun.</p>
    <h2>Golden Circles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What?:</strong> Helping businesses and organizations with building websites in order to help them gain attention.</li>
            <li><strong>How?:</strong>Coding skills</li>
            <li><strong>Why?:</strong>To take care of people and help grow my community.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Path</h2>
        <p>I honestly believe I would enjoy both being an employee and being an entreprenuer, but I think I would prefer being an employee first so I can learn a little bit more from others and get experience in an actual work environment in the industry. </p>
    <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
      <p>Hello my name is Kathleen and I'm learning web development in order to improve and help grow my community. Im doing this by taking a fullstack web development course with Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. What kind of opportunities can you see that would help your community?</p>

     <h2>Weekly Reflections: Week 1</h2>
    <h3>What did I learn this week?</h3>
      <p>This week we learned about how to build the basic structure of a website and how to deploy it, we also started learning about databases.</p>
    <h3>What felt like an accomplishment?</h3>
      <p>This week I would say the two things that I really felt accomplished about were that I feel almost totally comfortable with setting up a basic html file and when I figured out how primary and foreign keys work.</p>
    <h2>Weekly Reflections: Week 2</h2>
    <h3>What did I learn this week?</h3>
      <p>This week we went over databases more and I feel like I have a better understanding of that. We also went over Object oriented programming which is difficult but I feel like I'm beginning to understand the accessors and mutators now.</p>
    <h3>What felt like an accomplishment?</h3>  
      <p>At the beginning of the week I was very confused by the object oriented programming project. I still don't totally understand it but I felt like I could understand enough when following a guide to be able to accurately substitute out the variables with what I needed.</p>
     <h2>Weekly Reflections: Week 3</h2>
     <h3>What did I learn this week?</h3>
     <p>This week I learned a bit more about how to work with a team on projects and about version control thanks to the capstone project. I also learned more about online identites and about recruiters.</p>
     <h3>What felt like an accomplishment?</h3>
     <p>Something that felt like an accomplishment this week was when we were starting to work on the capstone and we were creating the interaction flows and personas. Before when we were creating them for the data design project I was a lot less confident in myself, but this time around I had a better idea as to what needed to be included.</p>
